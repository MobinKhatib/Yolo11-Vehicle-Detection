# 🚗 Vehicle and License Plate Detection

This project detects vehicles and extracts license plates from images under any lighting conditions — whether it's daylight or nighttime. It uses YOLO-based deep learning models to perform reliable and efficient detection.

## 📌 Features
- Vehicle detection from static images
- License plate extraction
- Works in various lighting conditions (day/night)
- Uses the [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) framework

## 🖼️ Sample Output
